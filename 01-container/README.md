# GO GO GO

The goal of this exercise is to show how neat multi-stage builds are. We've provided a (naive) Go implementation of a web server that returns a fibonacci sequence. Fill in the blanks in [Containerfile](./Containerfile) to create a container image. 

Make sure to test your image using `podman run`!
