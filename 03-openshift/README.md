# Seek and deploy

The goal of this exercise is to get a feeling for the OpenShift UI. So let's deploy our `fibonacci` application by navigating to the web console of our [OpenShift Sandbox](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/sandbox). Try to create a new application by uploading the YAML manifests you created in [Everything is YAML](../02-deployment/README.md) or straight from a container image by using the wizard provided by OpenShift. What do you see?

Now that we have our Deployment, how do we expose our application to the internet? Hint: you might need to create a Service first...
